## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Manual Workflow Setup** (GitHub App Limitations)
   ```bash
   # Copy workflow files to .github/workflows/
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp docs/github-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

2. **Configure Repository Secrets**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and Variables â†’ Actions
   - Add required secrets as documented in `docs/workflows/SETUP_GUIDE.md`

3. **Set Up Branch Protection**
   - Run the repository configuration script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup-repository.py
   ```

4. **Enable Security Features**
   - Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
   - Configure secret scanning and push protection
   - Set up code scanning with CodeQL

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development Setup**
   ```bash
   # Quick setup for new developers
   make setup
   
   # Or manual setup
   make install-dev
   make hooks-install
   ```

2. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   make test              # Run all tests
   make test-coverage     # Run with coverage
   make lint              # Code quality checks
   make security          # Security scans
   ```

3. **Development with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d   # Start development environment
   docker-compose --profile dev up -d  # With additional dev tools
   ```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Metrics Collection**
   ```bash
   python scripts/collect-metrics.py --summary
   ```

2. **Dependency Updates**
   ```bash
   python scripts/update-dependencies.py --batch safe
   ```

3. **Health Checks**
   ```bash
   python observability/health-checks.py
   ```
