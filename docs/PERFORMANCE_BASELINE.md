## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Algorithm Optimization
1. **Vectorization**: Use NumPy/Pandas vectorized operations
2. **Memory Layout**: Optimize data structures for cache efficiency
3. **Early Termination**: Implement convergence detection
4. **Batch Processing**: Process data in optimal batch sizes

### Infrastructure Optimization
1. **Container Resources**: Right-size CPU/memory allocation
2. **JIT Compilation**: Consider Numba for hot code paths
3. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiprocessing for I/O-bound operations
4. **Caching**: Implement intelligent result caching

### Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
performance_alerts:
  critical: # Immediate response required
    - "Processing time > 5x baseline"
    - "Memory usage > 2GB"
    - "Error rate > 5%"
    
  warning: # Monitor closely
    - "Processing time > 2x baseline"
    - "Memory usage > 1GB"  
    - "Performance degradation trend"
```
