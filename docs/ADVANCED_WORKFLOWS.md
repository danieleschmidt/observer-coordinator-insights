# Advanced GitHub Workflows

This document contains additional GitHub Actions workflows that can enhance the repository's SDLC maturity. These workflows require repository admin permissions to add.

## Security and Compliance Workflows

  schedule:
    - cron: '17 4 * * 2'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze (${{ matrix.language }})
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

## Automation Workflows

### 6. Auto-merge Dependabot (`auto-merge-dependabot.yml`)

Safely auto-merge dependency updates:

```yaml
name: Auto-merge Dependabot PRs

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  checks: read

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
    steps:
      - name: Get Dependabot PR metadata
        id: dependabot-metadata
        uses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v1
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

      - name: Auto-approve safe updates
        if: steps.dependabot-metadata.outputs.update-type == 'version-update:semver-patch'
        run: gh pr review --approve "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

      - name: Enable auto-merge for patches
        if: steps.dependabot-metadata.outputs.update-type == 'version-update:semver-patch'
        run: gh pr merge --auto --rebase "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

### 7. Stale Issue Management (`stale.yml`)

Manage inactive issues and PRs:

```yaml
name: Mark stale issues and pull requests

on:
  schedule:
  - cron: '30 1 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/stale@v9
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        days-before-stale: 60
        days-before-close: 7
        days-before-pr-close: 14
        stale-issue-label: 'stale'
        stale-pr-label: 'stale'
        exempt-issue-labels: 'enhancement,bug,good first issue,help wanted,blocked,security'
        exempt-pr-labels: 'enhancement,bug,security,ready-to-merge,work-in-progress'
        stale-issue-message: |
          This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
          recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs.
        stale-pr-message: |
          This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
          recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs.
```

### 8. Auto-labeler (`labeler.yml`)

The workflow to use the `.github/labeler.yml` configuration:

```yaml
name: Labeler
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/labeler@v5
      with:
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
        configuration-path: .github/labeler.yml
        sync-labels: true
```

## Installation Instructions

To add these workflows to your repository:

1. **Create the `.github/workflows/` directory** if it doesn't exist
2. **Copy the desired workflow files** from above into separate `.yml` files
3. **Customize the configurations** as needed for your repository
4. **Ensure you have the necessary permissions** or ask a repository admin to add them
5. **Test the workflows** by triggering their conditions (PRs, pushes, etc.)

## Benefits

Adding these workflows will provide:

- **üîí Enhanced Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and supply chain security
- **ü§ñ Intelligent Automation**: Smart dependency management and issue handling  
- **üìä Compliance Monitoring**: OSSF Scorecard and security posture tracking
- **üîç Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive code analysis and dependency review
- **‚ö° Developer Productivity**: Automated labeling and stale issue management

## Notes

- Some workflows require **GitHub Advanced Security** features
- **Repository admin permissions** are needed to add workflow files
- **Customize the configurations** to match your project's specific needs
- **Test thoroughly** before enabling auto-merge features
