# ADR-0002: Data Anonymization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Observer Coordinator Insights system processes sensitive employee personality data from Insights Discovery assessments. This data contains personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive behavioral profiles that must be protected to comply with:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- Internal corporate data governance policies
- Industry best practices for HR data handling

The system needs to perform meaningful clustering and analysis while ensuring individual privacy and preventing potential data breaches or misuse.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered data anonymization strategy:

### 1. Immediate Anonymization
- Remove all direct identifiers (names, employee IDs, emails) during data ingestion
- Replace with generated anonymous identifiers (UUIDs)
- Maintain identifier mapping table separate from analytical data store

### 2. Data Minimization
- Process only the minimum required Insights Discovery attributes needed for clustering
- Exclude optional demographic or organizational data unless specifically required
- Implement configurable data field selection

### 3. Statistical Anonymization
- Apply k-anonymity principles where k â‰¥ 5 for any queryable grouping
- Implement differential privacy techniques for aggregate reporting
- Add statistical noise to prevent individual identification through clustering results

### 4. Data Lifecycle Management
- Automatic data purging after 180 days (configurable)
- Secure deletion of all temporary processing files
- Audit logging of all data access and processing activities

### 5. Technical Implementation
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3
- Memory-safe processing to prevent data leakage
- No logging of sensitive data in application logs

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Compliance**: Meets GDPR, CCPA, and industry standard requirements
- **Trust**: Builds user confidence in data handling practices
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces legal and reputational risks from data breaches
- **Flexibility**: Configurable anonymization levels for different use cases

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: Additional processing overhead for anonymization/de-anonymization
- **Performance**: Slight performance impact from encryption and anonymization steps
- **Debug Difficulty**: Harder to debug issues without direct identifiers
- **Data Utility**: Some analytical capabilities may be limited by anonymization

### Technical Debt
- Requires ongoing maintenance of anonymization algorithms
- Need for regular compliance audits and updates
- Additional testing complexity for privacy-preserving features

### Migration Path
- Existing datasets will be retroactively anonymized using new strategy
- Legacy identifier mappings will be securely migrated or purged
- New API endpoints will enforce anonymization by default
