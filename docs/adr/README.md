## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?

## References
- Link to relevant discussions
- Related documentation
- External resources
```

## Guidelines

1. **Number consecutively**: Start with 001 and increment
2. **Use descriptive titles**: Make it clear what decision is being made
3. **Keep decisions atomic**: One decision per ADR
4. **Include rationale**: Explain why this decision was made
5. **Document alternatives**: Show what else was considered
6. **Update status**: Mark as superseded when decisions change
