# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Observer Coordinator Insights project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project development. Each ADR documents:

- The context and problem statement
- The decision made
- The consequences of that decision

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local]

## Decision
[Describe our response to these forces]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision]
```
