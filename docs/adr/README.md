# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Observer Coordinator Insights project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project development. Each ADR documents:

- The context and problem statement
- The decision made
- The consequences of that decision

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]
This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made during the development of the observer-coordinator-insights project.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|--------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./001-clustering-algorithm-selection.md) | Clustering Algorithm Selection | Accepted | 2025-01-15 |
| [ADR-002](./002-multi-agent-orchestration-framework.md) | Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework | Accepted | 2025-01-16 |
| [ADR-003](./003-data-privacy-and-security-approach.md) | Data Privacy and Security Approach | Accepted | 2025-01-17 |

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local]

## Decision
[Describe our response to these forces]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision]
```

## Index of ADRs

- [ADR-0002: Data Anonymization Strategy](./0002-data-anonymization.md) ✅

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template above
2. Number sequentially (next available number)
3. Use a descriptive title
4. Fill in all sections thoroughly
5. Link from this README
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?

## References
- Link to relevant discussions
- Related documentation

## Guidelines

1. **Number consecutively**: Start with 001 and increment
2. **Use descriptive titles**: Make it clear what decision is being made
3. **Keep decisions atomic**: One decision per ADR
4. **Include rationale**: Explain why this decision was made
5. **Document alternatives**: Show what else was considered
6. **Update status**: Mark as superseded when decisions change
