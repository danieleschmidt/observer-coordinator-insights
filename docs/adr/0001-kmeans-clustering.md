# ADR-0001: Use K-means Clustering Algorithm

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The system needs to cluster employees based on their Insights Discovery personality profiles. Several clustering algorithms were considered:

1. **K-means**: Simple, efficient, creates distinct non-overlapping clusters
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Good for understanding cluster relationships but computationally expensive
3. **DBSCAN**: Good for noise detection but requires density parameters that are hard to tune
4. **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic approach but more complex to interpret

The primary stakeholders are non-technical HR personnel who need clear, interpretable results. The system must handle datasets ranging from 50 to 5000 employees efficiently.

## Decision

We will use K-means clustering as the primary clustering algorithm for the following reasons:

1. **Interpretability**: Creates clear, distinct groups that are easy for HR teams to understand
2. **Performance**: Efficient O(n*k*i) complexity suitable for our dataset sizes
3. **Deterministic Results**: Consistent clustering with the same input data (when using fixed random seed)
4. **Well-established**: Mature algorithm with extensive documentation and best practices
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Non-technical users can easily grasp the concept of "k groups"

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast execution times even for large employee datasets
- Clear cluster boundaries make team assignment straightforward
- Extensive tooling and visualization support available
- Easy to validate results using silhouette analysis and elbow method

### Negative
- Requires pre-specification of cluster count (k)
- Assumes spherical clusters which may not match personality data distribution
- Sensitive to initialization (mitigated by using k-means++)
- May struggle with clusters of varying densities

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement automatic k selection using elbow method and silhouette analysis
- Provide cluster quality metrics to users
- Allow manual k override for domain experts
- Consider adding alternative algorithms in future versions if needed
