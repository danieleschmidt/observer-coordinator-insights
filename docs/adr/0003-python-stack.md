# ADR-0003: Python Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Observer Coordinator Insights project requires a technology stack that can effectively handle:

- Large-scale data processing and analysis
- Machine learning clustering algorithms
- Statistical computations and visualizations
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns
- Enterprise integration capabilities
- High-performance numerical computations

Several technology options were considered:
- **Python**: Rich data science ecosystem, mature ML libraries
- **R**: Statistical computing focus, strong visualization
- **Java**: Enterprise integration, performance, JVM ecosystem
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Full-stack consistency, modern tooling
- **Go**: Performance, concurrency, minimal dependencies

## Decision

We will use **Python 3.9+** as the primary technology stack with the following core libraries:

### Core Data Processing
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing and array operations
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and clustering

### Visualization and Reporting
- **matplotlib**: Low-level plotting and visualization
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **plotly**: Interactive web-based visualizations

### Configuration and I/O
- **PyYAML**: Configuration file parsing
- **pathlib**: Modern file path handling
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous processing capabilities

### Development and Quality Tools
- **pytest**: Testing framework with extensive plugin ecosystem
- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **black**: Code formatting (via ruff)

### Enterprise and Integration
- **FastAPI**: Modern API framework for integration endpoints
- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **requests**: HTTP client for external integrations

### Monitoring and Observability
- **prometheus-client**: Metrics collection and export
- **structlog**: Structured logging
- **opentelemetry**: Distributed tracing capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries for data science and ML
- **Community Support**: Large, active community with extensive documentation
- **Rapid Development**: High-level language enables fast prototyping and development
- **Scientific Computing**: Excellent numerical computing capabilities
- **Integration**: Easy integration with existing enterprise Python environments
- **Talent Availability**: Large pool of Python developers

### Negative Consequences
- **Performance**: Slower than compiled languages for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Memory Usage**: Higher memory footprint compared to languages like Go or Rust
- **Dependency Management**: Complex dependency trees can lead to conflicts
- **GIL Limitations**: Global Interpreter Lock limits true parallelism
- **Deployment Size**: Larger container images due to Python runtime and dependencies

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance Mitigation**: Use numpy/pandas for vectorized operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverage multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks
- **Memory Management**: Implement data streaming for large datasets
- **Dependency Isolation**: Use virtual environments and lock files

### Alternative Paths Considered
- **Java + Spring**: Better performance but slower development cycle
- **Go**: Excellent performance but limited data science ecosystem
- **R**: Strong statistics but limited general-purpose capabilities
- **JavaScript**: Consistent full-stack but weaker numerical computing

### Migration Strategy
- Containerized deployment reduces Python-specific deployment issues
- Clear module boundaries enable future polyglot architecture if needed
- API-first design allows component replacement in different languages
