# ADR-0004: Docker Containerization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The Observer Coordinator Insights system needs a consistent, reproducible deployment strategy that can work across:

- Local development environments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Production deployments
- Multi-cloud environments
- Different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)

The system handles sensitive data and requires:
- Consistent Python runtime environments
- Isolated dependency management
- Secure secret handling
- Performance optimization
- Easy scaling capabilities

Alternative approaches considered:
- **Virtual environments**: Python-specific, not infrastructure-agnostic
- **System packages**: OS-dependent, difficult to reproduce
- **VM images**: Heavy, slow to build and deploy
- **Native binaries**: Complex build process for Python applications

## Decision

We will use **Docker containerization** with the following strategy:

### Container Architecture
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime environments
- **Minimal base images**: Use Python 3.9-slim for reduced attack surface
- **Non-root execution**: Run application as non-privileged user
- **Layer optimization**: Optimize for Docker layer caching

### Security Implementation
- **Distroless runtime**: Minimal runtime environment without shell
- **Secret management**: Environment variable injection, no secrets in images
- **Security scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Image signing**: Cryptographic signing of production images

### Performance Optimization
- **Multi-stage builds**: Reduce final image size by excluding build dependencies
- **Dependency caching**: Leverage Docker layer caching for dependencies
- **Parallel builds**: Use BuildKit for parallel build stages
- **Resource limits**: Define CPU and memory constraints

### Development Workflow
- **docker-compose.yml**: Local development with dependencies (Redis, databases)
- **Development Dockerfile**: Hot reloading and debugging capabilities
- **Volume mounting**: Source code mounting for development iteration

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Consistency**: Identical environments across development, testing, and production
- **Portability**: Runs on any Docker-compatible platform
- **Isolation**: Complete dependency isolation prevents conflicts
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling in container orchestration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with automated pipelines
- **Reproducibility**: Bit-for-bit identical deployments

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: Additional layer of abstraction and tooling
- **Resource Overhead**: Container runtime overhead (minimal but present)
- **Storage Requirements**: Image storage and registry management
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Docker knowledge and best practices
- **Build Time**: Multi-stage builds can be slower than simple deployments

### Technical Implementation

#### Dockerfile Structure
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage  
FROM python:3.9-slim
RUN adduser --system --no-create-home nonroot
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /home/nonroot/.local
COPY src/ /app/src/
USER nonroot
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["python", "-m", "src.main"]
```

#### Security Considerations
- Regular base image updates for security patches
- Non-root user execution prevents privilege escalation
- Minimal runtime reduces attack surface
- Secret injection via environment variables only

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Image size**: ~150MB for production image
- **Build time**: ~2-3 minutes with cold cache
- **Memory overhead**: ~50MB container overhead
- **Startup time**: <5 seconds for application initialization

### Migration and Rollback
- **Blue-green deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Version tagging**: Semantic versioning of container images
- **Rollback capability**: Previous versions available in registry
- **Database migrations**: Handled separately from container deployment

### Monitoring Integration
- **Health checks**: Built-in container health check endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging to stdout/stderr
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics exposed on dedicated port
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
