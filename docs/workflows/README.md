# GitHub Workflows Documentation

This directory contains documentation and templates for GitHub Actions workflows that need to be manually created due to repository permissions.

## Required Workflows

The following workflows should be created in `.github/workflows/` directory by a repository administrator:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive continuous integration with multi-Python testing, linting, and security scanning.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.9-3.12)
- Ruff linting and formatting
- MyPy type checking
- Bandit security scanning
- Safety dependency checking
- Pytest with coverage reporting
- Build artifact validation

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability assessment.

**Key Features**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with Safety and Bandit
- Container security scanning with Trivy and Grype
- Secrets detection with TruffleHog
- SBOM generation with CycloneDX
- License compliance checking
- Semgrep static analysis

**Triggers**: Push, Pull requests, Weekly schedule

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release process with semantic versioning.

**Key Features**:
- Automated changelog generation
- PyPI package publishing
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- GitHub releases with assets
- Version tagging and management

**Triggers**: Version tags, Manual workflow dispatch

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Repository Administrator** should create these workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
2. Copy the workflow configurations from `docs/github-workflows/` directory
3. Configure required secrets in repository settings:
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` for PyPI publishing
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage reporting
   - Any additional service tokens

## Workflow Templates

The complete workflow templates are available in the `docs/github-workflows/` directory:

- `ci.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline configuration
- `security.yml` - Security scanning automation
- `release.yml` - Release automation workflow

## Security Considerations

- All workflows include security scanning and validation
- Sensitive operations require manual approval for external PRs
- All artifacts are validated before deployment
- Audit trail is maintained for all automated actions

## Integration with Repository

These workflows integrate with the existing repository structure:

- Uses existing `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Leverages pre-commit hooks configuration
- Integrates with Makefile commands
- Supports existing test structure and markers

## Manual Setup Required

After creating the workflows, the following manual setup is needed:

1. Configure repository secrets for external services
2. Enable workflow permissions for the repository
3. Set up branch protection rules that require workflow success
4. Configure notification settings for workflow failures

For detailed workflow configurations, see the template files in `docs/github-workflows/` directory.
