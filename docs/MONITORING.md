# Monitoring and Observability

## Overview

This document outlines the monitoring and observability strategy for the Observer Coordinator Insights application.

## Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

### Recommended APM Solutions

For production deployments, consider integrating one of these APM solutions:

- **New Relic**: Python agent with ML/AI monitoring capabilities
- **DataDog**: Comprehensive APM with custom metrics
- **Elastic APM**: Open-source option with ELK stack integration
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Self-hosted metrics collection and visualization

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### Performance Metrics
- Request/response times for clustering operations
- Memory usage during large dataset processing
- CPU utilization during algorithm execution
- Cache hit/miss ratios

#### Business Metrics
- Number of clustering operations per day
- Dataset size distributions
- Team simulation success rates
- API endpoint usage patterns

#### Error Metrics
- Exception rates by module
- Failed clustering operations
- Data validation errors
- Authentication/authorization failures

## Logging Strategy

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: System failures, data corruption, security issues
- **WARN**: Performance degradation, deprecated API usage
- **INFO**: Successful operations, user actions, system state changes
- **DEBUG**: Detailed execution flow (development/troubleshooting only)

### Structured Logging

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Example usage
logger.info(
    "clustering_completed",
    dataset_size=len(data),
    clusters_generated=n_clusters,
    execution_time_ms=duration_ms,
    user_id=user_context.id
)
```

### Log Aggregation

For production environments:
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Fluentd**: Unified logging layer
- **Loki**: Prometheus-inspired log aggregation

## Health Checks

### Application Health Endpoints

Implement health check endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Basic application health
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe (can accept traffic)
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness probe (application is running)

### Database Health
- Connection pool status
- Query response times
- Data integrity checks

### External Dependencies
- Third-party API availability
- File system access
- Cache system status

## Alerting

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Application down/unresponsive
- Database connection failures
- Security breaches detected
- Data corruption identified

### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
- High memory usage (>80%)
- Increased error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>5s)
- Disk space running low

### Alert Channels
- Email notifications
- Slack/Teams integration
- PagerDuty for critical issues
- SMS for after-hours emergencies

## Performance Benchmarking

### Continuous Performance Testing

Integrate performance tests into CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Performance benchmark
  run: |
    pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only --benchmark-json=benchmark.json
    
- name: Performance regression check
  run: |
    python scripts/check_performance_regression.py
```

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Clustering Performance**: Time to cluster N employees
- **Memory Efficiency**: Peak memory usage per dataset size
- **Scalability**: Performance degradation with dataset growth
- **API Response Times**: 95th percentile response times

## Security Monitoring

### Security Events to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Suspicious clustering patterns

### Security Metrics
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API rate limiting triggers
- Data export frequency
- User behavior anomalies

## Container and Infrastructure Monitoring

### Docker Metrics
- Container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Container restart frequency
- Image vulnerability scan results
- Registry pull statistics

### Kubernetes Monitoring (if applicable)
- Pod health and restarts
- Node resource utilization
- Network traffic patterns
- Persistent volume usage

## Dashboard Configuration

### Executive Dashboard
- System availability (uptime %)
- Active users
- Processing volume
- Critical alerts count

### Operations Dashboard
- System performance metrics
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization
- Deployment status

### Development Dashboard
- Build/test success rates
- Code coverage trends
- Dependency vulnerability counts
- Performance benchmarks

## Compliance and Audit Logging

### Audit Events
- Data access and modifications
- User authentication/authorization
- Configuration changes
- Export operations

### Retention Policies
- Application logs: 90 days
- Audit logs: 7 years (or per compliance requirements)
- Performance metrics: 1 year
- Security events: 2 years
