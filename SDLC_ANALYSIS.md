# SDLC Analysis for observer-coordinator-insights

## Classification
- **Type**: Library/Package with CLI capabilities
- **Deployment**: PyPI package + CLI tool + Docker container
- **Maturity**: Beta (v0.1.0 - feature complete, stabilizing)
- **Language**: Python 3.9+

## Purpose Statement
A Python library and CLI tool that uses multi-agent orchestration to derive organizational analytics from Insights Discovery personality assessment data, automatically clustering employees and simulating optimal team compositions for cross-functional task forces.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Python tooling**: Full development setup with ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage
- **Well-structured ML pipeline**: Clean separation between data parsing, clustering, and simulation
- **Security-conscious**: Data anonymization, encryption, privacy compliance built-in
- **Professional documentation**: Architecture docs, ADRs, clear README with roadmap
- **Docker-ready**: Containerization setup for deployment
- **Quality tooling**: Pre-commit hooks, comprehensive testing framework
- **Monitoring infrastructure**: Observability, metrics collection, health checks

### Gaps
- **Missing GitHub Actions**: Workflow files exist in docs/ but not in .github/workflows/
- **No PyPI publishing**: Library not yet published to package index
- **Limited API documentation**: Missing detailed API reference for library usage
- **No performance baselines**: Missing benchmarking for clustering algorithms
- **Integration examples**: Limited examples of using as a library vs CLI
- **Versioning strategy**: Missing semantic release automation

### Recommendations
- **Priority 1 (P1)**: Enable GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- **Priority 1 (P1)**: Add comprehensive API documentation for library usage
- **Priority 2 (P2)**: Implement PyPI publishing workflow
- **Priority 2 (P2)**: Add performance benchmarking and optimization guides
- **Priority 3 (P3)**: Create integration examples for common use cases
- **Priority 3 (P3)**: Add semantic release automation

## Technical Context
