We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Disclose Publicly
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### 2. Report Privately
Send an email to security@terragon-labs.com with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Fix Development**: Depending on severity (1-14 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Data Anonymization**: All PII is automatically anonymized during processing
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit is encrypted
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive operations
- **Audit Logging**: All data access and modifications are logged

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning of Docker images
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR Compliant**: Built-in support for data subject rights
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies
- **Consent Management**: Tracking and management of data processing consent
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Automated data deletion capabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
3. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all communications
4. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Data Validation**: Always validate input data before processing

### For Developers
1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
4. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite
5. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
- Application-level security controls
- Container security hardening
- Network security policies
- Infrastructure security monitoring

### Threat Model
Our security model addresses:
- **Data Exposure**: Preventing unauthorized access to employee data
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring analysis results are not tampered with
- **Availability**: Protecting against denial of service attacks
- **Privacy**: Maintaining confidentiality of personal information

## Vulnerability Management

### Scanning and Detection
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image security scanning
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

### Response Process
1. **Detection**: Automated or manual vulnerability detection
2. **Assessment**: Risk and impact evaluation
3. **Prioritization**: Based on CVSS score and exploitability
4. **Remediation**: Patch development and testing
5. **Deployment**: Coordinated security update release
6. **Verification**: Post-fix security validation

## Compliance and Certifications

### Current Compliance
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- Privacy by Design principles
- OWASP Application Security standards

### Planned Certifications
- SOC 2 Type II (in progress)
- ISO 27001 compliance (planned)

## Security Tools and Integrations

### Development Security
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security scanner
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's code analysis engine

### Infrastructure Security
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanner
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile security linter
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Dependency vulnerability detection

### Monitoring and Response
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual pattern identification
- **Incident Response**: Automated security incident handling

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security settings
ENABLE_ENCRYPTION=true
AUDIT_LOGGING=true
DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true
GDPR_COMPLIANCE=true

# Data retention (days)
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=180
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=2555  # 7 years

```

### Secure Deployment
```dockerfile
# Run as non-root user
USER insights

# Minimal attack surface
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl tini && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Health checks
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=60s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```
